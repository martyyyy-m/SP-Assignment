# SOCP Security Vulnerabilities - Fixed

**Security Review Status:** Completed ‚Äì Vulnerabilities Mitigated

---

## Overview

This document details the actual security fixes implemented to address intentional vulnerabilities in the SOCP (Student Overlay Chat Protocol) system. The fixes maintain architectural compatibility while adding necessary security enforcement. This version has been trimmed to align precisely with the final commit and does **not** reference features that were not implemented.

## Vulnerability 1 ‚Äì Presence Replay Gap

### ‚úÖ Description  
Previously, the introducer did not enforce full replay protection for presence messages, allowing attackers to replay previously observed presence updates to spoof user status.

### ‚ö† Security Impact  
- Fake ‚Äúonline‚Äù status could be shown for users  
- Manipulation of presence directory  

### ‚úÖ Fix Implemented  
üìç Location: `socp/node.py` ‚Äì `IntroducerServer.process_frame()`

‚úÖ Controls added:
| Control | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Early replay drop | `(msg_id, nonce)` pairs are checked before any state change. Replayed `HELLO` and `PRESENCE_UPDATE` frames are immediately rejected. |
| Signature enforcement | `HELLO` and `SERVER_HELLO_JOIN` are verified using public keys provided in the body. All other state-changing frames must be signed using the *registered* public key. |
| Registered sender check | Only senders with known registered keys may send state-changing messages. |
| Basic rejection logging | Replay/signature failures are logged by the introducer for visibility. |

### ‚úÖ Outcome  
Attackers can no longer replay presence frames as they are rejected before any update is processed.

## Vulnerability 2 ‚Äì Client-Induced Operator-Like Removal (Hidden Authority Issue)

### ‚úÖ Description  
Originally, clients could broadcast `USER_REMOVE` on disconnect, effectively acting with server-level authority and forcing removal events.

### ‚ö† Security Impact  
- Clients could arbitrarily remove users from the directory  
- Denial of service via false removal events  

### ‚úÖ Fix Implemented  
üìç Location: `socp/node.py` ‚Äì `ClientNode`

| Change | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| Removed client-side emission of `USER_REMOVE` on disconnect | Clients can no longer impersonate server-level authority. |
| Restricted removal flow to introducer/server only | Only trusted actors issue membership removal. |
| Ensured `conn_to_ctx` existence | Client cleanup is now state-consistent without broadcasting forced removals. |

### ‚úÖ Outcome  
Clients cannot trigger global directory changes; authority is correctly centralized in the introducer.

---

## Additional Correctness Enhancements

| Area | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Introducer key preload | Ensures both `self_privkey` and `self_pubkey` are correctly loaded at startup. |
| Connection context management | `ClientNode` maintains `conn_to_ctx` safely for clean disconnection flow. |

---

## Manual Verification Steps

‚úÖ Replace project `socp/node.py` with the updated version, then test:

| Test | Expected Result |
|------|-----------------|
| Start introducer | Works normally |
| Connect clients (HELLO) | Success (valid signature required) |
| Send PRESENCE_UPDATE | Accepted if registered + signed |
| Replay old PRESENCE_UPDATE | Rejected (duplicate `(msg_id, nonce)`) |
| Try to emit `USER_REMOVE` from client | Ignored/rejected |
| Normal messaging (DIRECT_MSG, GROUP_MSG) | Operates normally |

---

## Verification Notes (For Report Submission)

‚úÖ Replayed frames are ignored  
‚úÖ Signature verification is enforced  
‚úÖ Unauthorized directory removals are blocked  
‚úÖ Normal flows are preserved  
‚úÖ Introducer logs rejections  

---

## Final Notes

This patch focuses strictly on mitigating the presence replay and client-induced operator escalation vulnerabilities, ensuring proper authority boundaries and message authenticity. If future administrative or extended validation features are added, a follow-up report will be issued.
