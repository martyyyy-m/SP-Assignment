# SOCP Security Vulnerabilities - Fixed

**Author of Security Fixes:** Heet Parmeshwar Patel (A1963465)

## Overview

This document details the fixes implemented for two intentional vulnerabilities that were identified in the SOCP (Student Overlay Chat Protocol) system. The fixes maintain the existing architecture while adding essential security controls.

## Vulnerability 1: Presence Replay Gap

### Description
The original implementation allowed spoofing of presence records due to incomplete replay protection logic for presence messages. Attackers could replay old presence updates to manipulate user status information.

### Security Impact
- Spoofed presence records
- Potential for showing users as online when they're offline
- Manipulation of user status information

### Fix Implemented
**Location:** `socp/node.py` - `IntroducerServer.process_frame()` method

**Security Controls Added:**
1. **Signature Verification**: All presence updates now require valid RSA signatures from known users
2. **Timestamp Validation**: Messages older than 60 seconds are rejected to prevent replay attacks
3. **Sender Authentication**: Only known users with registered public keys can send presence updates
4. **Enhanced Logging**: All rejected presence updates are logged for security monitoring

**Code Changes:**
- Added signature verification using `m.verify_envelope(frame, sender_pub)`
- Implemented timestamp checking with 60-second window
- Added proper error handling and logging for invalid presence updates

## Vulnerability 2: Hidden Operator Override

### Description
The original design included a backdoor that allowed bypassing identity restrictions using a shared secret (SOCP_OPERATOR_CODE), enabling attackers to assume another user's identity.

### Security Impact
- Complete identity assumption
- Bypass of authentication controls
- Potential for unauthorized access to private messages

### Fix Implemented
**Location:** `socp/run_node.py` - `run_cli()` function and `socp/node.py` - `IntroducerServer.process_frame()` method

**Security Controls Added:**
1. **Strong Authentication**: Requires minimum 32-character operator codes
2. **Constant-time Comparison**: Uses `hmac.compare_digest()` to prevent timing attacks
3. **Limited Operations**: Admin operations restricted to status checks only (no identity assumption)
4. **Comprehensive Auditing**: All admin operation attempts are logged
5. **Environmental Security**: Operator code must be set via environment variable

**Code Changes:**
- Added `admin-op` command with proper authentication
- Implemented secure ADMIN_OP message handling
- Added ADMIN_RESPONSE message type for secure responses
- Restricted admin operations to status checks only
- Added comprehensive security logging

## Additional Security Enhancements

### Enhanced Replay Protection
- Improved message ID and nonce duplicate detection with logging
- Better error reporting for duplicate messages

### Key Validation
- Added RSA-4096 key validation during user registration
- Enhanced error handling for invalid public keys
- Improved sender ID validation

### Timestamp Security
- Added fresh timestamps to presence updates
- Implemented client-side timestamp validation

## Security Testing Recommendations

1. **Presence Replay Testing**: Attempt to replay old presence messages - should be rejected
2. **Admin Operation Testing**: Test admin operations without proper operator code - should be denied
3. **Timing Attack Testing**: Verify constant-time comparison for operator codes
4. **Key Validation Testing**: Test with invalid or weak keys - should be rejected

## Configuration Security

To maintain security, ensure:
1. Set `SOCP_OPERATOR_CODE` environment variable with strong 32+ character code
2. Monitor logs for security events and rejected operations
3. Regularly rotate operator codes
4. Restrict access to systems running with admin privileges

## Compliance Notes

These fixes address the security vulnerabilities while maintaining:
- Backward compatibility with existing legitimate operations
- Minimal changes to the core architecture
- Comprehensive logging for security auditing
- Clear separation between regular and administrative functions
